NBG Payment Plugin temp fix


National Bank of Greece is using Simplify Commerce for the eshops that use NBG.
This creates a problem in the transation beacuse at least for not it does not accept greek characters for those whou uses woocommerce.
So i developed this  plugin to "Translate" the greek characters to englis characters once the user has inserted them.

For any questions contact me .
